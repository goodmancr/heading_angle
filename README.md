# Mouse Heading Angle in Arena

In the study of animal behavior, heading angle can be an important feature when trying to understand ethograms (a list of species-specific behaviors).

In attack-flee studies, there is a prey (mouse) and a predator (spider). 2D videos are recorded as the mouse interacts with the spider in an arena. To better understand mice behavior with respect to the spider, heading angle is calculated to understand the relationship between various behaviors and the locations/positions of the predator and prey.
